# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

## Project Overview
Embarking on my first Kaggle competition and venturing into machine learning, this project focuses on the classic Titanic dataset. The challenge is to predict the survival of passengers based on features such as class, sex, age, among others.

In this project, I've learned and applied data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and constructed various machine learning models. The experience culminated in the submission of predictions to the Kaggle platform, which tested the models against an unseen test set.

## Kaggle Competition
This repository's analysis corresponds to the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), a beginner-friendly contest providing data for training machine learning models to predict survival aboard the Titanic.

## Learning Outcomes and Results
Tackling my first machine learning project, I have gained knowledge on:

- The nuances of data cleaning and preprocessing.
- The importance of exploratory data analysis for uncovering patterns.
- The intricacies of machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- The critical practice of model performance evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

Scores from various machine learning algorithm submissions to Kaggle are as follows, showcasing the accuracy of each model:

The most successful model was a hard voting classifier, achieving an accuracy score of approximately 79.2%. These experiences have laid a foundation for my future endeavors in machine learning and data science.
